# ProgrammingLanguages

This repository contains my personal learning notes and code examples for various programming languages, including:

- 🟦 C
- ➕➕ C++
- ☕ Java
- 🐍 Python

## 📁 Structure

- `C/` – Basic C programs and syntax practice
- `C++/` – Object-oriented concepts and templates
- `Java/` – OOP fundamentals, exceptions, collections
- `Python/` – Scripting, input/output, functions, operators
- `.obsidian/` – ⚠️ Ignored: local Obsidian configuration (not part of Git)

## 📘 Goal

To consolidate my knowledge across multiple languages, track progress, and build a strong foundation for advanced topics like:

- Data structures & algorithms  
- Object-oriented programming  
- Artificial intelligence basics (Python)  
- Microcontroller programming (ESP32 with C/C++)

## 🚀 Future Ideas

- Add project folders per language  
- Solve coding challenges (e.g. Leetcode, HackerRank)  
- Document key concepts as Markdown notes
